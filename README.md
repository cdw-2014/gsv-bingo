# gsv-bingo

Inspired by the Street View Bingo series by GeoWizard on YouTube.

## Description

Submit your own suggestions for of things to find while looking around on Google street view. Things may include descriptions of people, cars, buildings, landmarks, events, etc. along with any qualifiers you'd like (e.g. color, country, or amount of the thing).

You can also generate your own bingo boards made from the suggestions and play a game yourself. A 20 minute timer is built into the board if you'd like to use it.
